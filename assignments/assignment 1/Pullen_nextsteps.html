  <h1> This Week's Fish: A Narrative Supply Chain Map for Mermaid's Garden</h1>


Data for the project will come from these sources. </p>

<p>This project researches the existing supply chain of CSF (community supported fishery) in Brooklyn called Mermaid's Garden. They distribute sustainably sourced east coast fish, from Florida to Maine. Emails sent to members of the CSF describe the catch, fish, method, vessel, port and state of each week's fish. Trip-level data about sustainable fishing vessels will be summarized in relation to the CSF before it is presented in a narrative supply chain map. </p>

<p>What: A narrative supply chain map about the ground fishery The bigger picture will be in a realtime map beside a narrative of existing activity.</p>

<p>Why?: The goal is to make a useful decision-making tool for a CSF. The map will describe the existing supply chain in relation to fishing vessel trips. 

<p>I am looking for trip-level reporting on sustainable fishing boats.  </p>
