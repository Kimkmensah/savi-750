  <h1> This Week's Fish</h1>

<p>This project researches the existing supply chain of a community supported fishery in Brooklyn. Mermaid's Garden distributes fish caught in sustainable ways from Florida to Maine. Emails sent to members of the CSF describe the catch, fish, method, vessel, port and state of each week's fish. Trip-level data about sustainable fishing vessels will be summarized in relation to the CSF before it is presented in a narrative supply chain map. </p>

<p>The goal is to make a useful decision-making tool for a CSF. The map will describe the existing supply chain in relation to fishing vessel trips. </p>

<p>The data I am looking for is trip-level reporting on sustainable fishing boats. A narrative supply chain map about the ground fishery The bigger picture will be in a realtime map beside a narrative of existing activity. Data will come from these sources.</p>
