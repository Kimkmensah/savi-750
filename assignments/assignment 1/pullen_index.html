  <h1> Reality Properties: Fake Estates</h1>
   <p>Sara Eichner</p>
   <p>Visual artist Sara Eichner made this map in a class with Eric Brelsford, Advanced Web Mapping at Pratt Institute in 2016 to visualize a significant conceptual artwork online, in a contemporary context.

This map tells the story of Gordon Matta Clark's 1973 project Fake Estates on the left, with with maps of odd lots from 2016 on the right. Scrolling down Javascript refreshes to keep the map in sync with the part of the story you are reading. Information on each site comes from various sources: street addresses come from monographs on the artists' work, which Eichner correlates by block and lot number to data from NYC Oasis interactive landuse maps and MapsPluto, in Carto. 

The map has great style. A muted backgound (grey, off whites) with pops of color on sites and typeface are clean and legible. The split view is cool too; seeing two kinds of information at once captures my attention. It is interesting to compare two dated versions of the same thing: paper maps embedded in the narrative with Carto. Changes between 1973 and 2016, through images of deeds, transfer files, and estimated values presented as two blocks distinct of time in New York City. 

This project is useful to me as a model to follow. She worked really hard on this project. The source code is on her github page.
